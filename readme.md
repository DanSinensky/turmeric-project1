# Card Table Simulator

An application that allows the user to make and use decks of playing cards with custom backs, and save the board state (who has what cards and the position of the cards on the the table) to local storage. App will differentiate between faceup and facedown cards, as well as cards that the player is allowed to look at and not look at.
